  <h1>Gi Hyeong-do</h1>
  <p>Old book- 
    It's close to a miracle
    
    that I've lived
    
    I was moldy for what seemed an eternity
    
    How can I predict my own life
    
    in a damp dark world
    
    in an order where no one bothers to look at me,
    
    in empty hope?
    
    Other people hurriedly take a few contents
    
    and coveting one another's functions
    
    insert their bookmarks into me
    
    Others say my life has been too easy
    
    that I need thicker memories
    
    
    Every person who ever looked at me once
    
    left me, my soul is mostly dark pages, who will ever open me?
    
    But in that case they have no right to discourse on lies
    
    Lies and truth must dream the same objective
    
    and they can be found in the exact same line
    
    I don't believe in miracles
